# Adwaita.CSS: libadwaita for web applications

**TL;DR: This stylesheet mimics latest Adwaita (libadwaita style). See the [live demo](https://tylerms887.github.io/adwaita.css) to see results.**

A stylesheet that makes native HTML elements look like they came straight from the GNOME desktop.

## Install

### Release

See [Releases](https://github.com/TylerMS887/adwaita.css/releases) for instructions.

**It is recommended to use the latest stable version.**

### Development

Add the following to your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<style>@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TylerMS887/adwaita.css/main/adwaita.css");</style>
```

This imports the current work on Adwaita.CSS. It is not recommended to deploy your website while targeting the `main` branch instead of a release.
